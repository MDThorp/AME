# AME  ApallMultislitExtension

This code is designed for use while extracting calibrated spectra with multiple apertures inside IRAF/PyRAF's apall package inside twodspec.apextract. It ultimately takes in a coord file and outputs database files for use inside apall. Also can input wavelengths, and output database files.
